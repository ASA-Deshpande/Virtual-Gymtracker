Count the number of Bicep Curls Performed using MediaPipe and OpenCV

The global pandemic has ushered in an era of digitalization. With everything from education to marketing going online, staying in shape has especially been a challenge in the social-distancing scenario. This project aims to address this aspect, with the creation of a model that will use pose-estimation as a method to count the number of bicep reps performed correctly, decreasing the need of an instructor 24/7 and thus help in exercising remotely.  This can be further extended for other exercise poses like push-ups and Yoga Asanas as well.
